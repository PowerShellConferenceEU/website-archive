Most of us have probably written a Pester test or two, but! Do you know what makes a good or a bad unit test? When you look at your code do you know what you should or shouldn’t be testing? Can you tell the difference between an integration test and a unit test? In this session we will use personal examples of tests written when first starting out to highlight both good and bad testing practices, unit and integration tests and maybe a few Pester tips and gotchas. Note: whilst this session uses Pester for its examples, this session is more about the philosophy of software testing and less about the intricacies of Pester."

After Jason got back “home”, this project made its way back to the PowerShell core. In this session I will try to share with you current “state of the art”, and show you how you can create dynamic completers for your modules. I will also share how adding custom completers will look in the future, when PowerShell version 5 will become de facto standard version. Expect a lot of demos and some examples of how you can create module/command specific completers and completers that will work for any command on your system."

              de: "In August of 2016, Microsoft officially open sourced the PowerShell project. This is an important step towards making PowerShell a single platform for automation of management/administration tasks on all operating system variants, not just Windows. Naturally, many open source powershell developers rushed to make sure their script modules were compatible with PowerShell Core and open source PowerShell on non-Windows operating systems. Porting script modules turns out to be a “relatively” painless process, but binary modules create additional problems to overcome. In this presentation, I will discuss writing Binary PowerShell Modules targeting the PowerShell Core and open source PowerShell, specifically focused on modules built to run in *nix environments. I will cover writing P/Invoke definitions for Linux and Mac OSX function calls, reviewing source code to see how Microsoft does it, and how to add operating system detection logic.  Finally, I will demonstrate running PowerForensics on a non-Windows platform."

Testing our code can be complicated, because it often touches the infrastructure. Do we then need a complete test infrastructure? Doesn't that make the test project time-consuming and cumbersome?
