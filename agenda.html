In a high-security environment where strict AppLocker or Device Guard rules are deployed, PowerShell exposes a large attack surface that can be used to circumvent security controls. While constrained language mode goes a long way in preventing malicious PowerShell code from executing, attackers will seek out vulnerabilities in trusted signed code in order to circumvent security controls.

<td class="Security" data-toggle="tooltip" title="With the relentless proliferation of compiled and script-based malware, trusting prevention and detection to antivirus solutions alone simply won&#39;t cut it. The only ideal method of effectively blocking binaries and scripts on a host is with a robust whitelisting solution. Device Guard is one such solution offered by Microsoft for Windows 10 and Server 2016 and if implemented properly, can eliminate an entire suite of attacks your organization may face. Additionally, the only interface into configuring Device Guard is with PowerShell.
Device Guard, like any other whitelisting solution, will never be impervious to bypasses, however. A robust solution will, however, provide mechanisms to block known bypasses. Device Guard provides such functionality in addition to providing features that can effectively block rogue administrators from altering policies or disabling the service.
This talk will cover PowerShell-based configuration and deployment of a restrictive whitelisting policy, bypasses to the policy through exploitation of trusted applications, and mitigation strategies for effectively blocking such bypasses.">Architecting a Modern Defense using Device Guard and PowerShell<br/><small>Matthew Graeber (English)</small><br/></td>

<td class="Cross-Platform_and_Open_Source" data-toggle="tooltip" title="In August of 2016, Microsoft officially open sourced the PowerShell project. This is an important step towards making PowerShell a single platform for automation of management/administration tasks on all operating system variants, not just Windows. Naturally, many open source powershell developers rushed to make sure their script modules were compatible with PowerShell Core and open source PowerShell on non-Windows operating systems. Porting script modules turns out to be a &#8220;relatively&#8221; painless process, but binary modules create additional problems to overcome. In this presentation, I will discuss writing Binary PowerShell Modules targeting the PowerShell Core and open source PowerShell, specifically focused on modules built to run in *nix environments. I will cover writing P/Invoke definitions for Linux and Mac OSX function calls, reviewing source code to see how Microsoft does it, and how to add operating system detection logic.
