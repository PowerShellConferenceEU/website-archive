                            PowerShell Conference Europe is the largest PowerShell-themed conference in Europe, and is held in Hanover, Germany each
                            year. We attract speakers and attendees from all over the world, with such topics as security,
                            DevOps, databases, core language features, optimization, DSC, best practices and much more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you use PowerShell in your daily job, this conference is the perfect opportunity to enchance your skillset as well as
                            build your network with like-minded individuals. The talk between each session is often where
                            the magic happens! All speakers are available (as much as it's possible) throughout the whole
                            conference, and are approachable for questions and discussions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each year Microsoft also sends a delegation from the PowerShell team, and this is a unique opportunity to interact directly
                            with the people responsible for developing PowerShell.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2018, we extend the conference from 3 to 4 days and include a new PowerShell Guerilla Evening. Delegates get the chance
                            to actually work with some of the many new and exciting technologies, guided by speakers and
                            experts. Instead of just listening to presentations, the Guerilla Evening gives you the opportunity
                            to actually put things to work and get high class guidance. For example, security expert Will
                            Harmj0y and colleagues will point you to the tools required to defend IT environments, and you'll
                            actually see and learn how PowerShell can be used as a forensic tool, how attackers think, and
                            how you can defend attacks. Bring a notebook if you'd like to code yourself, or just follow the
                            demos.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The conference is organized by the community, for the community! And we are happy to welcome you to yet another brilliant
                            conference on April 17-20, 2018. Will we see you there?
                        </p>

It involves having everyone in the team in a single chat room, then bringing tools into the room so everyone can automate, collaborate and see how automation is used to solve problems. In doing so, you are unifying the communication about what work gets done and have a history of it happening.
                      In this session we will go through setting up Chat automation using PowerShell, how to hit the ground running and what steps to take to convert your existing code base and make it work from Chat. From there on we will dive into how we can securely deploy, manage and administer this as a platform. Expect a session filled with demos and real-world insights of bringing this live in a production environment.">Using Chat Automation (ChatOps)<br/><small>Jaap Brasser</small></td>

Or, is it your hair that is constantly on fire, and you simply do not have the time to add proper documentation to your code? That’s common place, look around - yet it’s not very clever. PowerShell scripts become integral part of your business logic. Without documentation, you waste time for others to service your code, and may even violate legal requirements. As a professional PowerShell scripter, you want to make sure your code is accompanied by professional-looking and complete documentation. Just how do you approach this?
                      Lean back, join this workshop, and become friends with PlatyPS! PlatyPS is the new tool used by both Microsoft and Community that help you to create professional documentation for your PowerShell projects in no time:
                      • Just how do you (quickly) add good documentation to your existing code? PlatyPS is the answer: fast bootstrapping for existing projects!
                      • How can documentation show both in the PowerShell help system, and can be published to websites? PlatyPS is the answer: compatible both with maml and markdown, documentation displays in PS help system and on websites
                      • How do you maintain and update your documentation with new versions of your code, and new functions or new parameters introduced? PlatyPS is the answer: version control friendly documentation, support for updating existing help
                      • Finally: how do you work as a team? PlatyPS is the answer: enable others to contribute to your documentation with ease.
                      PlatyPS adds the professional touch to your PS projects, and is completely free. Join the list of these popular modules that already use platyPS: Azure-Powershell, Powershell-Docs, PSReadLine.
                      In this workshop we will cover:
                      • onboarding for an existing project (bring your own or use a sample one!)
                      • standard workflow for platyPS: creating new help, updating help, creating maml from markdown.
                      • hosting your markdown documentation.
                      • best practices of markdown authoring.
                      • Continuous Integration - never have out-of-date documentation again! 
                      • How comment-based help benefits from platyPS.
                      As a bonus we will talk about few advanced topics that haven’t been widely discussed before:
                      • support for multiple versions in a single file.
                      • localization story.

                      This is the perfect chance to hop on the train if you ever wondered what DSC is, how it can help you better manage infrastructure, and what a “Release Pipeline” is. The workshop provides much practical knowhow even for those who already work with DSC.
                       
                      We’ll first review the underpinning principles of managing infrastructure in a robust and trustworthy way. Then, step by step, we demonstrate how an existing infrastructure can be defined, put under DSC control, and changes deployed. We&#39;ll guide you through a quick setup of a representative lab of a legacy infrastructure with a domain and few services. We&#39;ll introduce our Continuous Integration (CI) tool, a VSTS instance, and create our build pipeline for PowerShell modules, introduce the concepts and replicate the learnings to other pipelines used in Infrastructure management. 
                       
                      We&#39;ll then start composing our DSC solution by composing Configurations and Resources into roles, to change our pets into cattle, adopting a flexible configuration data model defining the infrastructure similar to Puppet, Chef and Ansible.
                      Attendees are free to follow along and deploy the solution in their own Azure Resource Group. By running the demo code they will experience first-hand how change is promoted throughout the staging rings, from Dev to Prod, and how the puzzle fits together. At the end of this workshop, you’ll have made friends with DSC and know how to tackle your own infrastructure.">Workshop: Bring Existing Infrastructure under Code Control<br/><small>Matthew Hitchcock, Gael Colas, Jan-Hendrik Peters, Raimund Andree</small></td>
