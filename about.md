Welcome to Europe’s largest PowerShell-themed annual conference!

In 2020, we’ll have 350 delegate seats again and 40 international speakers. You will be able to build your personal agenda from 3 parallel tracks using our conference app (iOS, Android). Agenda information becomes available by end of January 2019.


<h2 id="content">Here is why people from 35 countries travel to Hannover to attend:</h2>

		<h3>Advanced PowerShell Topics</h3>
		<p>We want sessions to be even more practical, so most come with a promise: “When you attend this session, you will be able to [control Philips lights with PowerShell]/[execute code visibly in the context of another logged on user]/[stream data right into a database and create the required tables on the fly]/[identify top bottle necks in script code and speed up things by factor 200]/etc. pp. </p>
        <p>
        With roughly 80 sessions, there’s a lot of knowledge to harvest and take home.</p>

		<h3>Great Speakers</h3>
		<p>A ratio of 1 speaker per 10 delegates makes psconf.eu very personal. Speakers are renown international industry experts with solid experience. Most have built popular PowerShell extensions like dbatools, have written books like “PowerShell Cookbook”, or have invented PowerShell itself like the PowerShell team from Redmond.</p>
        <p>There is always time for your questions, and our Speakers are curious to hear what you are doing with PowerShell.</p>

	<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Inspiring Delegates</h3>
		<p>Most delegates are experienced professional PowerShell users and automation experts who are writing and running the company’s automation scripts. You don’t have to be a PowerShell wizard to attend (although many wizards do). Anyone who dares can get the stage during lunch time for a 15 or 30 minute “Birds of Feather” slot. Test drive your career as a future speaker, and present tricks and techniques to fellow delegates and speakers.</p>
