        <p>On day one, we have two main tracks taking place in the awesome Beethoven Saal and in Blauer Saal. After the keynote in English, 
        you are free to choose between the two main tracks, one in English, and one in German. All tracks will be recorded.</p>
        <p>At the end of the first day, there will be an evening event. This event if free for participants.</p>
        <p>On day 2 + 3, we have up to 4 main tracks holding 75 attendees maximum each. There will always be one continuous track in English and one in German. 
        The other two tracks deliver presentations in various languages, repeat sessions, or discussions.</p>
        <p>We also have 7 breakout session rooms and an emergency room. The emergency room provides help and ad-hoc tutoring to bring you up to speed with topics you are not completely comfortable with. You can also make free appointments with experts for a 1:1 or 1:many.</p>
        <p>The remaining breakout session rooms will be used ad-hoc. If you want to take the presenter from a track with you, and discuss details or play yourself with his demos, you can get a breakout session room. Some rooms will be used to deliver refresher classes in RegEx, XML, or other topics, and allow PowerShell user groups to present themselves.</p>
