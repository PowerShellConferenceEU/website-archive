		<h2>Evening Event</h2>
		<p>All attendees are our guest at the awesome and very unique evening event taking place at the end of conference day 1. 
		We will all walk down to Yukon Bay, an ancient gold digger town in the center of Hannover Zoo that opens all night exclusively for us. 
		Surrounded by ice bears and penguins, this is the perfect place to decelerate, connect with others, enjoy great food and drinks, 
		and get to know PowerShellers from all across the world.<p>
