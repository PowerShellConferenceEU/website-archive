		<h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            In 2016, psconf.eu was the largest PowerShell conference world-wide, with 80+ sessions
            and 45 speakers from 5 continents.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2017, we again take a close look at all the exciting new extensions to the PowerShell
            ecosystem (i.e. PowerShell on Linux, Server 2016, Nanoserver on Azure, etc.), we’ll cover
            the opportunities introduced by Microsoft’s new “Open Source” strategy, we’ll look at hot
            topics like security, SQL Server tuning, real-world best practices, discuss how code can
            be maintained and distributed within your company teams or publicly, and leave plenty of
            room to discuss, learn, and look ahead.

            You likely have to get #management approval for a $500 expense. But you can call a 1 hour #meeting with 15 people and no one notices.
