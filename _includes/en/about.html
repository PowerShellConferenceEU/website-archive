		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the next great European PowerShell event!</p>
		<p>After the announcement that there will be no more PowerShell Summit Europe in the future, enthusiastic PowerShell Community Members and <b>Deutsche PowerShell Konferenz</b> decided to join forces and create an extraordinary PowerShell Community Event in Europe.</p>
		<p>We bring together PowerShell experts from around the globe, and create a unique 3-day event with presentations, workshops, the chance to connect, learn and discuss. There is no place like this to deep-dive PowerShell in all of its flavors and colors.</p>
		<p>The conference languages are English and German. There are continuous main tracks in both languages, making sure you can follow the tracks in the language you feel most comfortable with.</p>
		<p>2016 is Leibniz Year in Hannover. Leibniz researched more than 300 years ago, and some of his concepts like the Monadology are spiritual roots of PowerShell. It is easy to get to Hannover by railway or plane, and we secured hotel contingents that you can optionally take advantage of when you register.</p>
		<p>Conference seats are strictly limited to 160 attendees on a first-come-first-serve basis. Registration starts November 2. We will update this site as more information becomes available, so make sure you check back.
Note: All information presented here currently is preliminary and subject to change at any time.
