This may sound unrealistic but this is a legitimate concern of the PowerShell team when including PowerShell code in the operating system. In a high-security environment where strict AppLocker or Device Guard rules are deployed, PowerShell exposes a large attack surface that can be used to circumvent security controls. While constrained language mode goes a long way in preventing malicious PowerShell code from executing, attackers will seek out vulnerabilities in trusted signed code in order to circumvent security controls.\nThis talk will cover numerous different ways in which attackers can influence the execution of your code in unanticipated ways.

Microsoft have released a Release Pipeline whitepaper and demo guide to get you set up in TFS, but what does it mean to actually implement this?\nIn this session, Matt will walk through how he has helped a large Microsoft customer make the transition to Infra-as-Code for one of their core technologies. We will take a look at the timeline of events and activities that got us there, what a Release Pipeline actually looks like in practice with its supporting components and how it works together. More importantly, we will talk about the cultural resistance and challenges that were overcome along the way and what you might consider doing to get your organisation over those same hurdles."

I had a number of success criteria that had to be met. Checking all of these by hand (eye) would have been error prone, so I wrote a test to do this for me and an easy for management to read HTML report using PowerShell and Pester.\nThe session has come from that situation and is about enabling you to provide an easy to read output to quickly and repeatedly show that infrastructure is as expected for a set of checks. There are many use cases for this type of solution; DR testing, installation, first line checks, presentation setups\nAfter this session you will have a basic understanding of how Pester works and the capability to examine your checklists and create your own validation tests and provide some reporting for management. You will pick up ideas of processes and checks that can be automated within your company\nI am able to perform the following checks in 15 minutes across hundreds of servers and thousands of databases and I think it is cool and useful and everyone should be able to do so and take the functionality to create their own.\nEvery Job in Ola Hallengrens Maintenance Solution exists, is enabled, has a schedule, has succeeded, has 2 job steps, has a generate restore script job step, the root backup folder is contactable, for every database the correct folders exist for the full, differential and log backup depending on recovery model in that folder, that each of those backup folders has files in it, that the most recent file in each of those folders is less than the required frequency for those jobs"

You let Timmy PowerShell remote in on the default endpoints since manually configuring new endpoints on all 3000 is not easy. Timmy then “accidentally” starts deleting content that he should have never touched on nodes he should have never been on.\nSound familiar?  The problem that many IT Pros have with remoting endpoints is that they do not know how to deploy them in mass.  Constrained endpoints can allow your staff to work with specific components of PowerShell only, preventing the next Timmy from making a costly mistake.\nIn this deep dive, we will take a look at PowerShell remoting and learn how to use it to deploy constrained endpoints rapidly across your organization allowing you to follow the “Principle of Least Privilege” in the PowerShell world."

Many, if not all, monitoring tools will warn you if something which has been configured has gone wrong. But not a lot of them will tell you if something was never configured in the first place. \u000bIn my search for a solution I ran into Pester tests, and the Operations Validation Framework (OVF) in particular. \nThe existing OVF framework itself was not \"dynamic\" enough for my needs, so I decided to roll my own. \nBased on the Convention over Configuration paradigm my code tests the whole landscape and can quickly identify if some configuration does not adhere to (my own) best practices or even if exceptions that I\u0027ve put in place are still configured as such.\nI will demo based on code that is actively used in production and my samples will use SQL Server because I\u0027m a database guy. But this session is also useful if you\u0027re not a SQL admin."

Automation is great, but writing code that runs faster gives you and your organization a tactical advantage.  Simply put, the faster things work, the more money you save.  What difference does a quarter of a second make?  Well, try working in an environment of 100,000 nodes.  Just a delay of .25 seconds per node will cost you an extra 7 hours.\nThis deep dive will take a look at various ways to gauge the speed of your code execution and tactics on how to accelerate your goals through the use of methods, background jobs, and simple coding techniques. Whether it is through remoting on-premises or reaching out to the cloud, we will make things happen faster."

Device Guard is one such solution offered by Microsoft for Windows 10 and Server 2016 and if implemented properly, can eliminate an entire suite of attacks your organization may face. Additionally, the only interface into configuring Device Guard is with PowerShell.\nDevice Guard, like any other whitelisting solution, will never be impervious to bypasses, however. A robust solution will, however, provide mechanisms to block known bypasses. Device Guard provides such functionality in addition to providing features that can effectively block rogue administrators from altering policies or disabling the service.\nThis talk will cover PowerShell-based configuration and deployment of a restrictive whitelisting policy, bypasses to the policy through exploitation of trusted applications, and mitigation strategies for effectively blocking such bypasses."

This is an important step towards making PowerShell a single platform for automation of management/administration tasks on all operating system variants, not just Windows. Naturally, many open source powershell developers rushed to make sure their script modules were compatible with PowerShell Core and open source PowerShell on non-Windows operating systems. Porting script modules turns out to be a “relatively” painless process, but binary modules create additional problems to overcome. In this presentation, I will discuss writing Binary PowerShell Modules targeting the PowerShell Core and open source PowerShell, specifically focused on modules built to run in *nix environments. I will cover writing P/Invoke definitions for Linux and Mac OSX function calls, reviewing source code to see how Microsoft does it, and how to add operating system detection logic.  Finally, I will demonstrate running PowerForensics on a non-Windows platform."
